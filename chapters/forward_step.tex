\subsection{Forward Step Problem}

\Figref{forward_step} shows a typical \emph{benchmark} problem in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It consists of a 2D duct with an inlet (at left) and an outlet of fluid (at right). On the inlet a Couette profile is present due a relative movement between the surfaces. The lower surface speed is set as been $U_0$, while the upper surface speed is set as been null.

The analytic solution of Reynolds Equation on the stationary state (there is no squeeze flow) is calculated making the right hand side of \eqref{reynoldseq} equal to zero and integrating it. This way the fluid flux is obtained on the inlet $Q_{in}$ been equal to:
\begin{equation*}
Q_{in}=-\left.\frac{H^3}{12\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right|_l+\frac{U_0}{2}H
.
\end{equation*}
This calculation is repeated for the fluid flux on the outlet $Q_{out}$, this time replacing $H$ by $H/2$ so the Couette flow on the outlet will be half the Couette flow on the input. As $Q_{in}=Q_{out}$ must be accomplish, a Poiuseille flow must appear on the outflow, which is the same, a negative pressure gradient is generated in order to compensate the lack on the Couette term. In fact, this gradient can be computed to be:
\begin{equation*}
\left.\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right|_{out} = 6\,a\,\mu\frac{(H/2-H)}{(H/2)^3}.\label{eq:pressure_gap}
\end{equation*}

\end{figure}

\Figref{u_prof_RE_NS} shows the velocity obtained by both Reynolds and Navier-Stokes equations. Notice the linear profile at the inlet (left side) and the non-linear (parabolic plus linear) on the outlet due to Couette and Poiseuille flows. It can be observed how the field $u$ changes suddenly at $x=0$ for the Reynolds solution. Obviously, this is due to a discontinuity of the gap $h$ there. On the other hand, the Navier-Stokes solution changes softly. In spite of that, they differ only by $1\%$ both in velocities and pressure.
