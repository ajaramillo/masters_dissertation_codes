@article{fortier2005,
abstract = {The behavior of a fluid-film bearing depends on the boundary conditions at the interfaces between the liquid and the solid bearing surfaces. For almost all solid surfaces, the no-slip boundary condition applies. However, a number of researchers have recently found that slip can occur with specially engineered surfaces. These include molecularly smooth surfaces and surfaces with micron-scale patterns. By constructing an engineered heterogeneous surface on which slip occurs in certain regions and is absent in others, the flow in the liquid film of a bearing can be altered, and such characteristics as load support and friction can be improved. In the present study, a numerical analysis of a slider bearing with such an engineered slip/no-slip surface is analyzed. Slip is assumed to occur when a critical shear stress is exceeded and follows the Navier relation. The results show that with a critical shear stress of zero, a significant increase in load support and decrease in friction can be achieved with an appropriate surface pattern. With nonzero values of critical shear stress, an instability occurs over a range of speeds. At speeds above this range, the bearing behaves similar to the case with zero critical shear stress, while below this range it behaves like a conventional bearing.},

@article{bonito2013,
abstract = {Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with discontinuous diffusion coefficients occur in application domains such as diffusions through porous media, electro-magnetic field propagation on heterogeneous media, and diffusion processes on rough surfaces. The standard approach to numerically treating such problems using finite element methods is to assume that the discontinuities lie on the boundaries of the cells in the initial triangulation. However, this does not match applications where discontinuities occur on curves, surfaces, or manifolds, and could even be unknown beforehand. One of the obstacles to treating such discontinuity problems is that the usual perturbation theory for elliptic PDEs assumes bounds for the distortion of the coefficients in the \$L\_\backslash infty\$ norm and this in turn requires that the discontinuities are matched exactly when the coefficients are approximated. We present a new approach based on distortion of the coefficients in an \$L\_q\$ norm with \$q<\backslash infty\$ which therefore does not require the exact matching of the discontinuities. We then use this new distortion theory to formulate new adaptive finite element methods (AFEMs) for such discontinuity problems. We show that such AFEMs are optimal in the sense of distortion versus number of computations, and report insightful numerical results supporting our analysis.},

@article{rahmani2009,
abstract = {In tribology, the Rayleigh step is known as a bearing with the highest load capacity amongst all other possible bearing geometries. In classical resources on tribology, it is also shown that there is an optimum geometry for the Rayleigh step providing the highest load capacity. However, the analyses are confined to a special case where the effect of hydrostatic pressure is neglected. Furthermore, the possible optimum parameters in terms of the friction force and/or friction coefficient as well as the lubricant flow rate have not been discussed. In this study, the Rayleigh step is comprehensively analysed including the effect of variations of pressure at the boundaries on the optimum parameters. In addition, the bearing is also optimised considering lubricant flow rate, friction force and friction coefficient. It is shown that the optimum bearing parameters are strictly dependent on the variations of the pressure at the boundaries. It is also verified that the optimum point(s) in terms of load capacity are not necessarily equal to the optimum point(s) considering friction coefficient and/or lubricant flow rate even though if there is no pressure difference between bearing endings.},
